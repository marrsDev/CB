1. On-Page SEO Optimization
On-page SEO involves optimizing the content, structure, and HTML of your page to make it more search-engine-friendly.

a. Keyword Optimization
Include Keywords Naturally: Yes, you can include SEO keywords in the About Us and Our Services sections, but avoid keyword stuffing. Use keywords naturally and contextually. For example:

About Us: "At Capital Builders, we specialize in high-quality aluminium windows and doors, offering customized solutions for homes and businesses."

Our Services: "Our aluminium window services include custom designs, energy-efficient solutions, and professional installation."

Focus on Long-Tail Keywords: Target specific phrases like:

"cost of aluminium windows in [Your City]"

"custom aluminium windows with fixed partition"

"energy-efficient aluminium windows"

Use Keywords in Key Areas:

Title Tag: Ensure your <title> tag includes primary keywords. For example:

html
Copy
<title>Aluminium Windows Cost Calculator | Custom Designs & Quotes | Capital Builders</title>
Run HTML
Meta Description: Write a compelling meta description with keywords:

html
Copy
<meta name="description" content="Calculate the cost of custom aluminium windows with our user-friendly tool. Get instant quotes for energy-efficient, stylish designs tailored to your needs.">
Run HTML
Headings (H1, H2, etc.): Use keywords in headings like:

html
Copy
<h1>Aluminium Windows Cost Calculator</h1>
<h2>Custom Aluminium Window Designs</h2>
Run HTML
Alt Text for Images: Add descriptive alt text to images, e.g., alt="Custom aluminium windows with fixed partition".

b. Content Optimization
Add High-Quality Content: Create detailed, informative content about aluminium windows, their benefits, and how your services stand out. For example:

About Us: Explain your expertise, years of experience, and commitment to quality.

Our Services: Detail the types of aluminium windows you offer (e.g., sliding, casement, fixed) and their benefits (e.g., energy efficiency, durability).

FAQs: Add a FAQ section targeting common queries like:

"How much do aluminium windows cost?"

"What is the lifespan of aluminium windows?"

"Are aluminium windows energy-efficient?"

Use Structured Data: Add schema markup to help search engines understand your content. For example:

FAQ Schema: For your FAQ section.

Local Business Schema: To highlight your business name, address, and services.

Product Schema: For the aluminium windows you offer.

c. Technical SEO
Improve Page Speed: Fast-loading pages rank higher. Optimize your page by:

Compressing images (use tools like TinyPNG).

Minifying CSS and JavaScript files.

Enabling browser caching.

Using a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

Mobile-Friendly Design: Ensure your site is fully responsive and works well on all devices.

Fix Broken Links: Ensure all internal and external links are working.

Use Canonical Tags: If you have similar pages, use canonical tags to avoid duplicate content issues.

2. Leverage the Functionality of Your Site
The cost calculator is a unique feature that can significantly boost your rankings if optimized properly. Here's how:

a. Make the Calculator a Key Selling Point
Highlight the Calculator: Use compelling copy to emphasize the calculator's value, e.g., "Get an instant quote for your custom aluminium windows in just a few clicks!"

Target Transactional Keywords: Optimize for keywords like:

Lead Generation: Use the calculator to collect user information (e.g., email, phone number) in exchange for the quote. This can help with remarketing and building a customer database.

Follow-Up: Offer to email the quote to users, which can help you build a mailing list for future promotions.

d. Create a Dedicated Landing Page
Consider creating a separate landing page for the calculator, optimized for specific keywords like "aluminium windows cost calculator." This page can rank independently and drive targeted traffic.

Share your page and calculator on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.

Use engaging visuals (e.g., before-and-after photos of aluminium window installations) to attract attention.

c. Online Reviews
Encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews on Google, Yelp, and other platforms. Positive reviews can improve your local SEO rankings.

Monitor Rankings: Use tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush to track your keyword rankings.
